A Power BI dashboard is an interactive and visually appealing data visualization tool that provides a high-level overview of business performance, KPIs, and trends in real-time.
It consolidates data from multiple sources, including databases (SQL, Excel, Azure), cloud platforms, and APIs, enabling users to make data-driven decisions efficiently. 
A Power BI dashboard typically consists of tiles, charts, graphs, KPIs, maps, and tables, each representing different aspects of the dataset. Unlike reports, 
dashboards are single-page summaries designed for quick insights, with the ability to filter, drill down, and interact with data dynamically. The key benefits of Power BI dashboards 
include real-time data updates, customizability, and collaborative sharing, making them highly useful for various industries such as sales, finance, human resources, and supply chain management.
Businesses use Power BI dashboards to track key performance indicators like revenue growth, profit margins, customer trends, and operational efficiency while identifying actionable insights. 
Furthermore, Power BI enables automated report generation, reducing manual data analysis efforts. The dashboardâ€™s intuitive design ensures that even non-technical users can explore data and 
derive meaningful insights, helping organizations optimize performance, forecast trends, and drive strategic decision-making.
